# Todo Application

A browser-based Todo application built as part of The Odin Project using HTML, CSS & JS.

[Live Demo](https://domradomski.github.io/todo-app/)

I focused on:

    Object-oriented architecture

    Clean state management

    Serialization & rehydration for storage

    Separation of concerns

    
- 🧠 Architecture Overview

    The application models data using a layered domain structure:

        User (global state module)
        └── Projects
            └── TaskLists
                └── Tasks


    Each layer owns its own logic, validation, and persistence behavior.


- 📦 Core Domain Classes
    
    - Task: Represents a single task.

        Fields: Title, Due date (validated Date instance), Priority (enum-esque), Notes, Completion state and Unique ID

        Methods:

            toggleComplete()

            toJSON()

            static fromJSON()

        Private fields are used for proper encapsulation.
        Serialization is explicitly controlled.

    - TaskList: Represents a collection of related tasks within a project.

        Fields: Title, Array of Task instances, Unique ID

        Methods:        

            addTask(task)

            removeTask(task)

            removeTaskById(id)

            getTaskById(id)

            toJSON()

            static fromJSON()

        Private fields are used to encapsulate internal state.

        Tasks are managed strictly through class methods to preserve data integrity.

        Nested serialization is handled explicitly to ensure Task instances are preserved during persistence.
    
    - Project: Represents a top-level container grouping multiple task lists.

        Fields: Title, Description, Array of TaskList instances, Completion state and Unique ID

        Methods:

            addToDo(list)

            removeToDo(list)

            removeToDoById(id)

            getToDoById(id)

            toJSON()

            static fromJSON()


        Private fields enforce encapsulation of nested TaskLists.

        Projects act as an aggregate root in the domain model, managing the lifecycle of their TaskLists.

        Serialization and rehydration are handled hierarchically to rebuild complex nested structures from plain JSON data.


- 💾 Storage Abstraction

    The Storage class provides a thin, defensive wrapper around the browser’s localStorage API.

    Rather than interacting with localStorage directly throughout the application, persistence is centralized behind this abstraction to:

        Prevent scattered storage logic

        Enforce consistent serialization

        Improve testability and maintainability

    Responsibilities:

        Validates availability of localStorage at runtime

        Serializes structured data before writing

        Parses stored JSON safely when reading

        Provides structured debugging output for inspection


- 👤 User Module (Global State Layer)

    The User module acts as the application’s top-level state manager and coordination layer.

    Unlike the domain classes (Project, TaskList, Task), the User is not a traditional class instance. Instead, it is implemented as a dedicated module that:

        Owns the global projects collection

        Manages currently opened tasks

        Provides controlled access to domain operations

        Coordinates persistence via the Storage abstraction

    Responsibilities:

        Initialises application state by loading and rehydrating Projects from persisted JSON

        Exposes pure helper functions for:

            Retrieving projects, lists, and tasks by ID

            Creating and removing domain entities

            Executing safe task mutations via higher-order utilities

        Acts as the single source of truth for application state

    The module pattern was chosen instead of a User class beacuse this is a simple project that was never going to have more than one user in this iteration of the project. In the future I'd like to revist this project and create a User class with authentication.


- 🔄 Serialization & Rehydration Strategy

    Application state is persisted using: JSON.stringify(projects)

    Why I needed toJSON():

        All domain classes use private fields (#field) for encapsulation.

        Private fields are not enumerable, which means JSON.stringify() cannot access them automatically. Without explicit serialization logic:

            Nested data disappears

            Complex structures flatten incorrectly

            Instances degrade into incomplete plain objects

        Each domain class implements a toJSON() method that returns a clean, explicit representation of its internal state.

        This ensures:

            Only intentional data is serialized

            No private implementation details leak

            Nested structures remain intact

    Rehydration via fromJSON():

        Data retrieved from storage is parsed into plain objects: JSON.parse(...)

        Plain objects do not contain:

            Class methods

            Prototypes

            Encapsulation

            Domain behavior

        To restore functionality, each layer implements a static factory:

            Task.fromJSON()

            TaskList.fromJSON()

            Project.fromJSON()

        Rehydration occurs hierarchically:

            Projects
            → TaskLists
                → Tasks


        Each level reconstructs real class instances and restores nested relationships.

        Some data required explicit reconstruction:

            Date parsing – Stored as strings, restored as validated Date instances

            Enum reconstruction – Priority values are restored with identity integrity, not just raw strings

        Without this layer, tasks would lose behavioral correctness despite “looking” valid in storage.


- 🎨 Renderer Architecture

    DOM logic is fully separated from domain logic.

    The renderer is implemented as an IIFE to create a self-contained UI layer with private helper functions and no leaked globals.

    This keeps DOM construction logic isolated from application state, exposing only a minimal public API while preventing accidental coupling to the rest of the system.

- 📱 Styling & Responsiveness

    The visual design evolved iteratively alongside development, using ChatGPT as a real-time styling assistant rather than a one-shot generator.

    The initial goal was a clean, modern interface built around:

        A predominantly white layout with a subtle blue hue

        Dark navy as the primary accent colour

        Strong visual hierarchy with restrained contrast

    The first step was generating a dedicated palette.css file to define reusable colour variables. These were previewed in a simple palette.html file to visually validate harmony, contrast, and usability before any layout work began.

    This ensured that colour decisions were deliberate and consistent across the application.

    Component-Driven Styling Process; Rather than prompting:

        “Build me a todo app”
        “Make this responsive”

    The interface was built incrementally.

    Each component was:

        Structured in HTML

        Styled intentionally

        Refined in context

    ChatGPT was used as a conversational CSS layer. In practice, this felt like writing plain English descriptions of visual intent and translating them into structured styling decisions.

    This approach allowed:

        Rapid iteration

        Cleaner layout composition

        More confident use of spacing and hierarchy

        A significantly more polished visual result

        The end product reflects collaborative refinement rather than automated generation.


- 🛠 Tooling

    Webpack is used for:

        ES module bundling

        Development server

        Production optimization

        Source maps

    Entry: src/index.js
    Output: dist/

    "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack",
        "start": "webpack serve --open"
    }

    npm run start launches the dev server and opens the app in the browser
    npm run build generates an optimized production bundle in dist/


- 🌍 Deployment

    The app is deployed using GitHub Pages.

    Deployment process:

    Run npm run build

    Push the compiled dist/ output to the deployment branch

    Configure GitHub Pages to serve that branch

    No backend infrastructure is required.


- 🔮 Future Improvements

    Formal User class

    Authentication

    Backend API

    Database persistence

    Task editing improvements

    Sorting & filtering

    Automatic list completion




- 🎓 What This Project Represents

    What began as a simple todo application developed into a structured exploration of application architecture.

    The focus shifted away from feature expansion and toward internal design quality:

        A layered domain model

        Explicit serialization and rehydration boundaries

        Clear separation between UI and business logic

        Deliberate state management

    The project ultimately became less about building functionality and more about building maintainable, well-structured software.
